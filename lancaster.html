            <h3>The "Lanc"</h3>
            <p>The classic British heavy bomber, this four engined machine could deliver 14,000 pounds of ordinance
            onto targets. It was also modified for a variety of other jobs, such as carrying the Bouncing Bomb,
            Tallboy bomb and the Grand Slam earthquake bomb.</p>
            <h3>In the Game</h3>
            <p>The Lancaster in the game has a cartoony style, in terms of looking stubbier, but generally has all
                of the standard components of the real plane. The bomber can be uparmoured and upgunned, and the
                addition of new types of engines increases its lifting power for these new components. The safety
                systems, fuel tanks, engines, crew equipment, engines, armour, turrets and livery can be customised.
            </p>
            <p>The bomber in game uses set loadouts depending on the mission, with some missions having unique
                munitions just for that raid, such as Operation Chastise providing a Bouncing Bomb for the mission.
                The loadouts are listed below.
